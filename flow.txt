1. Create HAProxy image based on library/haproxy with addition of sudo, iptables, procps, curl, vim and confd
apt-get update
apt-get install sudo
apt-get install iptables
apt-get install procps
apt-get install vim
apt-get install curl
curl -L https://github.com/kelseyhightower/confd/releases/download/v0.10.0/confd-0.10.0-linux-amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/confd
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/confd
mkdir -p /etc/confd/conf.d
mkdir -p /etc/confd/templates

2. Copy haproxy.toml to /etc/confd/conf.d/ of the image
3. Copy haproxy.tmpl to /etc/confd/templates/ of the image
4. Copy confd-watch to /usr/local/bin/ of the image
5. Make confd-watch executable
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/confd-watch

BUILD:
docker build -f DockerLibrary -t boris/haproxy .
RUN:
docker run -d --privileged=true --name haproxy -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 1936:1936 -e "HOST_IP=172.17.8.101" -e "SERVICE_80_NAME=proxy" -e "SERVICE_443_NAME=sproxy" -e "SERVICE_1936_NAME=statsproxy" -v /dev/log:/dev/log boris/haproxy /usr/local/bin/confd-watch
